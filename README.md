# **Automotive MPG - Linear Regression**  
  
## ***Project Overview***
*This project involves using a Linear Regression model developed in Python to predict continuous MPG values based on various different vehicle attributes (cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin).*
  
*The final product is available on Kaggle. It is an accurate regression model, with the ability to predict the MPG of vehicles from 1970-1982. It is beginner-friendly code, and is intended for all users.*  
  
## ***Project Workflow***
1. **Data Collection** - The Auto-mpg dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Kaggle page and contains 398 unique vehicles, and their related data.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** - Leveraged pandas to clean the data, detect any missing values, and perform EDA prior to model implementation.
3. **Model Development** - Built a Linear Regression model using Python's scikit-learn library to predict continuous MPG values for vehicles based on their attributes (cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin).
4. **Model Evaluation** - Evaluated our model's performance using metrics such as R², MSE, and RMSE.
5. **Visualization** - Visualized our model's performance by graphing residual values with scatterplots.

## ***Model Insights***  
- Performance Metrics: Our model demonstrates good accuracy in predicting continouous MPG values for these vehicles, which provides insight into the precision and recall for each species.
- Residual Graphs: Accuracy of the model was shown through residual grpahing where predicted values were plotted against their actual value counterparts, helping to assess model accuracy.
- Model Transparency: This Linear Regression model’s behavior can be analyzed through the coefficient values that were graphed via a bar chart.
